        The game of <strong>bowling</strong> dates back more than&nbsp;5 000&nbsp;years
        to ancient Egypt, where stone pins and balls were discovered in children’s tombs.
        Variations spread across Europe and, by the mid‑19th&nbsp;century, evolved
        into modern ten‑pin bowling in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today over 100 million people bowl in 90+ countries, playing casually with
        friends or competing at elite international events such as the World Bowling
        Championships and the PBA Tour.
      </p>
      <h2>Origins in Ancient Cultures</h2>
      <p>
        Ancient Germanic tribes practiced a form of bowling as a religious ritual, where throwing a stone at clubs was symbolic of clearing sins.
        Meanwhile, in Polynesia, a similar game called “ula maika” was played with intricately carved balls and pins.
      </p>

      <h2>Development in Europe</h2>
      <p>
        In medieval England, lawn bowling gained popularity among nobles and commoners alike.
        King Edward III even banned the game temporarily to encourage archery practice. Over time, it moved indoors and took on new forms.
      </p>

      <h2>Bowling in America</h2>
      <p>
        Immigrants brought various versions of bowling to North America, but it was in New York in 1895 that the first standardized rules for ten-pin bowling were established.
        This marked the birth of the American Bowling Congress, laying the foundation for professional leagues.
      </p>

      <h2>Modernization and Technology</h2>
      <p>
        The introduction of the automatic pinsetter in the 1950s revolutionized the game, making bowling more accessible and efficient.
        Today, innovations like synthetic lanes, computerized scoring, and advanced ball materials continue to evolve the sport.
      </p>

      <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Bowling alleys became community hubs in the mid-20th century, influencing pop culture, film, and fashion.
        From league nights to midnight cosmic bowling, the sport remains a timeless blend of skill, socializing, and fun.
